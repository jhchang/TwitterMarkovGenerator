# TwitterMarkovGenerator
Creates a markov chain from twitter data scraped from Trump's twitter page and
outputs text imitating his writing style.

This markov chain was using 2-grams and with little tweet data. If I want to
improve the realism of my model. I would increase the ngram size and scrape for
data from trump's twitter. I would also improve the preprocessing of the data
I scraped.

A file is also generated when this program is run that contains a count of all
significant words contained in tweets.
