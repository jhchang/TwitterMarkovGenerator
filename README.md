# trumpTwitterMarkovBot
Creates a markov chain from twitter data scraped from Trump's twitter page and outputs text imitating his writing style.

This markov chain was using 2-grams and with little tweet data. If I want to improve the realism of my model. I would
increase the ngram size and scrape for data from trump's twitter. I would also immprove the preprocessing of the 
data I scraped.
